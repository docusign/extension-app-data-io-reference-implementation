# Data IO Extension App Reference Implementation
## Introduction
This reference implementation models the use case of taking an agreement PDF sent by the Docusign platform using a data IO extension app and storing it locally.

## Setup instructions
### 1. Clone the repository
Run the following command to clone the repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/docusign/extension-app-data-writeback-reference-implementation.git
```

### 2. Generate secret values
- If you already have values for `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AUTHORIZATION_CODE`, you may skip this step.

The easiest way to generate a secret value is to run the following command:
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'));"
```

You will need values for `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AUTHORIZATION_CODE`.

### 2. Set the environment variables for the cloned repository
- If you're running this in a development environment, create a copy of `example.development.env` and save it as `development.env`.
- If you're running this in a production environment, create a copy of `example.production.env` and save it as `production.env`.
- Replace `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AUTHORIZATION_CODE` in `development.env` or `production.env` with your generated values. These values will be used to configure the sample proxy's mock authentication server. 
- Set the `clientId` value in the manifest.json file to the same value as `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`.
- Set the `clientSecret` value in the manifest.json file to the same value as `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`.
### 3. [Install and configure Node.js and npm on your machine.](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
### 4. Install dependencies
Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
### 5. Running the proxy server
#### Development mode:
Start the proxy server in development mode by running the command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will create a local server on the port in the `development.env` file (port 3000 by default) that listens for local changes that trigger a rebuild.

#### Production mode:
Start the proxy server in production mode by running the following commands:
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

This will start a production build on the port in the `production.env` file (port 3000 by default). 
## Setting up ngrok
### 1. [Install and configure ngrok for your machine.](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/)
### 2. Start ngrok
Run the following command to create a public accessible tunnel to your localhost:

```bash
ngrok http <PORT>
```

Replace `<PORT>` with the port number in the `development.env` or `production.env` file.

### 3. Save the forwarding address
Copy the `Forwarding` address from the response. Youâ€™ll need this address in your `manifest.json` file.

```bash
ngrok                                                    

Send your ngrok traffic logs to Datadog: https://ngrok.com/blog-post/datadog-log

Session Status                online
Account                       email@domain.com (Plan: Free)
Update                        update available (version 3.3.1, Ctrl-U to update)
Version                       3.3.0
Region                        United States (us)
Latency                       60ms
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    https://bbd7-12-202-171-35.ngrok-free.app -> http:

Connections                   ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90
                              0       0       0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00
```

In this example, the `Forwarding` address to copy is `https://bbd7-12-202-171-35.ngrok-free.app`.
## Create an extension app
### 1. Prepare your app manifest
Replace `<PROXY_BASE_URL>` in your manifest.json file with the ngrok forwarding address in the following sections:
- `connections.params.customConfig.profile.url`
- `connections.params.customConfig.tokenUrl`
- `connections.params.customConfig.authorizationUrl`
- `actions.params.uri`
    * Replace this value for all of the actions.

### 2. Navigate to the [Developer Console](https://devconsole.docusign.com/apps)
Log in with your Docusign developer credentials and create a new app.
### 3. Upload your manifest and create the data IO app
To [create your extension app](https://developers.docusign.com/extension-apps/build-an-extension-app/create/), open the [Developer Console] and select **+New App.** In the app manifest editor that opens, upload your manifest file or paste into the editor itself; then select Validate. Once the editor validates your manifest, select **Create App.**
